cost optimization setup guide this includes volume ,lamda

1)create an ec2 instance as usual with volume

2)go to volume setings in aws dashbord there we can see the volume code or we can find the volume id in our in our ec2

3)copy the volume id and use in to create a snapshot(full vol copy) we can find snapshot opp in the same dsash board

4)after check that vol snapshot has been done we will have a copy in the snapshot 

5)create new lamda function called cost-optmization-ebs-snapshot choose runtime - python and hit create

6)once the function over page open - go to git and copy the python code we have and paste it under the code source -save(ctrl+s)and hit deploy and test
it will fail because the invocation time is more then 10sec we didnt give permissions yet 

7)go to configration and increase the time and save it we need to keep the time less as possible

8)go to the code coloum permission are given based on roles so we have to give specific roles then only it will run so go to config again and -permission-iam user id -click on attach policy
-create a new policy [- describe instance ] [-give action (snapshot)-delete-list-giving permission] and save it -next-give name(cost-opt-ebs)-create policy

9)we have created a ppolicy-go to roles-select the role name-(search the name) now attach it to the permission add permission 

10)now lets see it shold not delete anything cause now snapshot is belogs to a volume which is attach to a ec2 -HIT Test

11)we can see once we delete the ec2 and volume our snapshotremains -success

12)we can edit code as delete the snapshot if its 30days old delete it

13) we can edit with if statements in multiple way using python code
