EDN concept
1)s3 is used to store binary large objest files like audio video and directly host it from s3

2)users can directly get access to s3 but thats not the best practice due to security ,latency ,cost.

3)so overcome all this we use a concept called CDN (cloud front in AWS)

4)we can take insta for example multiple users access from worldwide .if indian user update a pic from here an us user need not to go to 
s3 to get the file .CDN took a EDGE copy of the file and host it on worldwide nearest regions for that user .this the advantage in using EDN

5)ts provides lowest latency no data transfer cost and high security
